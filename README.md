## Command Examples

### Process Investigation
```powershell
# Process creation in the last 2 hours with detailed view
Investigate-ProcInfo -PastHours 2 -View "Detailed"

# Focus on specific process - show only cmd.exe launches in the last hour
Investigate-ProcInfo -ProcessName "cmd.exe" -PastHours 1

# Use wildcards to find processes - show all svchost processes in the last 20 minutes
Investigate-ProcInfo -ProcessName "*svchost*" -PastMinutes 20

# Specify exact time range using PowerShell's flexible datetime formats
Investigate-ProcInfo -FromUtcTime "2024-01-15 09:00" -ToUtcTime "2024-01-15 17:00"
```

### Network Investigation
```powershell
# Show network connections in chronological order over the last 4 hours
Investigate-NetworkConnections -PastHours 4 -View "Timeline"

# Find all connections to Google DNS server in the last day
Investigate-NetworkConnections -DestinationIp "8.8.8.8" -PastDays 1
```

### File System Investigation
```powershell
# View all file creation events in chronological order for the last 2 hours
Investigate-FileCreateInfo -PastHours 2 -View "Timeline"

# Monitor suspicious activity - find files created in any Temp folder in the last 6 hours
Investigate-FileCreateInfo -TargetFilename "*\Temp\*" -PastHours 6
```

### Registry Investigation
```powershell
# View registry value changes with sortable/filterable table for the last hour
Investigate-RegSetValueInfo -PastHours 1 -View "InteractiveTable"

# Watch for persistence - monitor changes to Windows startup registry key
Investigate-RegSetValueInfo -RegKey "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"
```

### Remote Analysis (Testing Phase)
```powershell
# Note: Remote analysis is in testing phase - use with caution
# Requires: PowerShell remoting must be enabled on the target system
# Investigate process activity on a remote computer with authentication
$Credential = Get-Credential
Investigate-ProcInfo -ComputerName "RemotePC" -Credential $Credential -PastHours 24
```

### Offline Analysis (Testing Phase)
```powershell
# Note: Offline analysis is in testing phase - use with caution
# Requires: Sysmon and Garuda to be installed on the analysis system
# Analyze pre-collected Sysmon logs in timeline format for forensic analysis
Investigate-ProcInfo -LogFile "C:\Logs\sysmon.evtx" -View "Timeline"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Check PowerShell Version
```powershell
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion  # Should be 7.0 or higher
```

### Verify Sysmon is Running and Generating Events
```powershell
# Check Sysmon service status
Get-Service sysmon

# Verify Sysmon is generating events (should show recent events)
Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" -MaxEvents 5

# Check if Process Creation events (ID 1) are being generated
Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" -FilterHashtable @{ID=1} -MaxEvents 3
```

**If no events**: Your Sysmon configuration may not be enabling the required events. Consider using a comprehensive Sysmon configuration file.

### Module Loading Issues
```powershell
# Check modules are available
Get-Module -ListAvailable Garuda*

# Force reload if needed
Remove-Module Garuda* -Force
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What if my investigation returns no results?
**A:** Check that Sysmon is generating events for the time period you're investigating. Start with `-PastMinutes 30` for recent activity.

### Q: How do I know which cmdlet to use for my investigation?
**A:** Start with `Investigate-ProcInfo` for process activity, `Investigate-NetworkConnections` for network activity, or use the reference table to find cmdlets by Event ID.

### Q: How far back can I search?
**A:** This depends on your Sysmon log retention settings. Windows Event Log has size limits that will affect how far back events are available.

### Q: Which installation method should I choose (user vs system)?
**A:** Use **user installation** if you don't have admin privileges or want to keep Garuda for your account only. Use **system installation** if you want all users to access Garuda.

### Q: How do I configure Sysmon properly for Garuda?
**A:** Use a filtered Sysmon configuration that enables logging for required events. Popular configurations available from the community:
- **SwiftOnSecurity's sysmon-config**: [https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config)
- **Olaf Hartong's Sysmon-Modular**: [https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular)

### Q: What if I get "execution policy" errors?
**A:** Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser` to allow PowerShell script execution for your user account.
